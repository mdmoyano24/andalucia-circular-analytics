# Policy Brief: Circular Economy and Sustainable Consumption in Andalusia

## Context
The European Green Deal and the EU Circular Economy Action Plan set ambitious objectives to reduce municipal waste and increase recycling rates. Andalusia, as part of Spain and the EU, must align with these targets while securing environmental and social benefits. Evidence-based monitoring of household behaviours and waste management is essential to support this transition.

## Key Findings

1) **Municipal waste per capita**
- Spain has generated less municipal waste per capita than the EU-27 average since 2011.  
- In **2022**, Spain recorded **482 kg/person**, versus **515 kg/person** for the EU-27. The latest EU-27 value is **511 kg/person in 2023** and Spain’s value is **465**.

2) **Packaging recycling rate (recycling, not recovery)**
- Spain’s **packaging recycling rate was 69.4% in 2022**, similar to the EU-27 average (**~65.3%**).  
- The medium-term trend is fairly flat.

> _Note:_ Eurostat distinguishes **recycling** (material recycling, including organic recycling) from **recovery** (recycling **plus** energy recovery). This brief uses **recycling** figures to align with EU targets.

3) **Household sustainable habits (ESOC 2023, Andalusia)**
- **Waste-reduction measures:**  
  - **87.4%** bring their own bag/trolley when shopping.  
  - **74.8%** repair devices.  
  - **57.8%** repair clothes/shoes.
  - **54.7%** avoid excessive packaging.
- **Food waste reduction:**  
  - **45.9%** do not usually discard food.
  - **25.3%** food in bad condition.
  - **24.9%** expired products.
  - **16.8%** leftovers from meals.

4) **Gap between policy targets and household practices**
- EU targets emphasise prevention, reuse and recycling, yet household behaviours remain uneven—especially on **prevention** (repair/reuse and avoiding waste). The risk of stagnation in packaging recycling underscores the need to accelerate prevention and improve separate collection quality.

## Implications for Policy
- **Spain and Andalusia are broadly aligned with EU waste-reduction trends**, but a **plateau in packaging recycling** may hinder progress toward 2030 targets unless prevention and collection quality improve.  
- **Household action is pivotal**: willingness exists (bags, avoidance of extra packaging), but uptake of **repair/reuse** can grow further.

## Recommendations

1) **Strengthen prevention and reuse at household level**  
- Scale local repair workshops, textile-reuse initiatives and user-friendly second-hand platforms.  
- Run targeted food-waste campaigns grounded in ESOC evidence.

2) **Link household behaviours to EU targets**  
- Build Andalusia-level indicators connecting ESOC results with Eurostat benchmarks.  
- Track **prevention metrics** (repair/reuse/avoidance) alongside recycling outcomes.

3) **Support municipalities as key actors**  
- Provide tools and incentives for high-quality separate collection and community reuse schemes.  
- Pilot packaging-reduction partnerships with SMEs and retailers.

4) **Enhance evidence-based policy design**  
- Automate data pipelines (Eurostat + ESOC + Junta datasets).  
- Publish **open, reproducible** indicators to improve transparency and public trust.

## Conclusion
Andalusia is well positioned to contribute to EU circular-economy objectives. Success requires a dual focus:  
- **Macro:** maintain the downward trajectory of municipal waste and improve packaging recycling in line with EU benchmarks.  
- **Micro:** embed sustainable consumption at home—especially prevention, repair and reuse—using ESOC insights to target interventions.
